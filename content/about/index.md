I am a Statistics Master's student at Brigham Young University. I enjoy sports, singing, and spending time with my family.

I have previously interned as an Analyst at Energy Exemplar and a Data Scientist at UnitedHealth Group. Currently, I do research and work as a teaching assistant at BYU. I have also done research for "Effectively Wild", a FanGraphs baseball podcast.
