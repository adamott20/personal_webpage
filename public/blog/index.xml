      <description>Grouping similar baseball players is essential to teams. It could allow a larger sample size when predicting batter vs. pitcher matchups or reduce the amount of information needed on a scouting report.
There are a variety of possible metrics by which to cluster hitters, but I will focus on just two: the exit velocity and launch angle of their batted balls. I focus on these two characteristics of batted balls because by knowing a ball’s exit velocity and launch angle, you know what the probable result of the play is.</description>

      <description>In August 2020 on Episode 1580 of “Effectively Wild”, there was a discussion about “Combined Half No-Hitters”, where neither team allows a hit through 4.5 innings, leading to 9 total half-innings without a hit. I did the queries in my Retrosheet database to find a list of every combined half no-hitter.
To look this up, I first read in attached my R session to my PostgreSQL database using the “dbcon.</description>

      <description>In baseball, although the most important factor in whether a pitch is called a strike or not is the location of the pitch, umpires and catchers also have some effect. Some catchers are better at ``framing&#34; a pitch, presenting it to look like it was thrown in the strike zone. Understanding which catchers are good at framing can help teams know which catchers to attempt to sign or trade for.</description>

      <description>Throughout 2020, I have helped answer baseball research questions for the FanGraphs podcast “Effectively Wild.” Every couple of weeks, one of the hosts will reach out to be asking if I can find the answer to a baseball history question for a segment known as a “Stat Blast.” To answer the questions, I have largely used two databases: a Retrosheet database I have on my own laptop (set up using a tutorial from Bill Petti at https://billpetti.</description>
